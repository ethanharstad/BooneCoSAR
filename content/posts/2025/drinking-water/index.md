At 1312 hrs, Boone County Search & Rescue was dispatched to assist Boone County Emergency Management and the Boone County Sheriff's Office in delivering and distributing bottled water to the City of Pilot Mound after a water system failure left the community without service.

While much of our work involves search and rescue operations, this call-out is a reminder that our mission extends to any form of disaster or community need, whenever and wherever Boone County residents need help.

A huge thank-you to our local partner, Boone Hy-Vee for their generosity in donating a pallet of bottled water to support the response.

Water is available to Pilot Mound residents at the City Shed (103 1st St.) and Deck’s Station.

Boone County Search & Rescue is proud to serve alongside our county partners and community to support our neighbors in times of need.
