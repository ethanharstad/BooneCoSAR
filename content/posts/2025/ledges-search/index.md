Boone County Search & Rescue would like to extend our sincerest thanks to the 59 volunteers who joined us today at Ledges State Park to assist in the search for Jesse Leopold.

Your willingness to give your time and effort made a tremendous impact, and we are grateful for your dedication and commitment to helping bring closure to Jesse’s family and friends.

We would also like to thank the Boone County Sheriff’s Office and all other agencies who supported today’s search operation.

Community support like this is what makes a difference in difficult missions. Thank you for standing with us.

At this time, we did not locate Jesse or find any clear signs related to his disappearance during today’s search. Our team, along with the Boone County Sheriff’s Office, remains committed to assisting in efforts to bring closure to Jesse’s family and friends.
