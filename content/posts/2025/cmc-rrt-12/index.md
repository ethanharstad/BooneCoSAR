Over the past week, three of our members attended the CMC Rope Rescue School in Iowa City.
They enhanced their skills while working alongside teams from across Iowa and Minnesota.
Training covered high lines, pick-off techniques, patient packaging, litter tending, vertical ascending and descending, and real-world scenarios where these skills were applied.

We train hard every day to improve our capabilities and make our team a trusted asset to the region.
Completing this grueling class was one more step in that commitment.

Weâ€™re proud to now have three certified Rope Rescue Technicians on our team, along with many more Operations-level personnel ready to answer the call.
Thank you to everyone who has supported us along the way.
Your support has helped make our goals achievable.
We remain dedicated to bettering ourselves and serving our region to the highest standard.
