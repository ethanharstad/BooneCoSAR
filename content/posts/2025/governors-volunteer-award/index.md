Boone County Search & Rescue Honored with 2025 Governor’s Volunteer Award!

We’re proud to share that Boone County Search & Rescue has been recognized by the State of Iowa with the Governor’s Volunteer Award for 2025!

This award acknowledges not only the dedication of our team during search and rescue operations, but also our commitment to public outreach and education throughout Boone County.

From braving the elements during emergency calls to engaging with schools, community events, and safety demonstrations—we do it all with one goal: to serve and protect our community.

This honor belongs to every volunteer who gives their time, their skill, and their heart to help others.
