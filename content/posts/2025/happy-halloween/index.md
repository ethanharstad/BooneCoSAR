🎃 What a Spook-tacular Two Weeks! 👻

Boone County Search & Rescue has been busy! Over the last two weeks, our volunteers have attended six Trunk-or-Treat events, completed our weekly trainings, and even responded to a callout all while building out our glowing, fog-filled pirate ship display you may have seen sailing through the county!

A huge thank you to every one of our volunteers for the time, creativity, and late nights that went into transforming our rescue boat into a haunted masterpiece. ⚓💀 Your commitment to this team and this community is unmatched.

And thank you to everyone who came out to visit us — and the Boone County Sheriff’s Office — at all the events. We loved seeing the costumes, handing out candy, and connecting with families across the county.

Until next year… fair winds and following seas, Boone County! 🏴‍☠️🚤✨
