Not every call is a dramatic rescue, but our members never need an excuse to put a boat on the water.

At 1736 hrs, Boone County Search & Rescue was dispatched to Don Williams Lake for a pontoon boat that had slipped its mooring and drifted into the lake.

Our team responded with six members and launched SAR 93, our largest rescue boat. The pontoon was safely located, secured, and towed back to the dock without incident.

The boat was given a friendly warning about the dangers of boating solo. 😉⚓️
