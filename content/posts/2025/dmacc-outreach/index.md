Today members of Boone County Search & Rescue had the opportunity to attend a Community Outreach event at DMACC alongside several of our public safety partners. Members of the public got a firsthand look at the tools and techniques we use to perform technical rescuesâ€”including a full rope rescue system demonstration and one of our rescue boats.

Both of our SAR trucks were on display, as well as our disaster response trailer, giving attendees an inside look at how we prepare for all types of emergencies across the county.

We were proud to join:

- Boone County Sheriff's Office
- Boone County Jail
- Boone County 911 Communications
- Boone County Emergency Management
- Boone County Hospital
- LifeFlight
- UnityPoint K-9 Unit

Events like this are an awesome way to connect with the next generation of responders and help showcase the teamwork that goes into keeping our community safe.
