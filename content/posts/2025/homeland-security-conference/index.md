Yesterday, Sheriff Godzicki, Sergeant McCrea, and Emergency Management Coordinator Chris Hayes had the honor of presenting on the formation and mission of Boone County Search & Rescue at the 2025 Iowa Homeland Security Conference.

This annual conference brings together emergency management coordinators, homeland security professionals, state agencies, elected officials, and nonprofit organizations from across Iowa to share ideas, experiences, and lessons learned.

Our presentation, “From the Ground Up: Building a Rural SAR Team That Delivers,” highlighted the challenges of creating a modern, multi-discipline Search & Rescue team in a rural county and the incredible results that come from community partnerships, volunteer dedication, and a shared mission to serve.

We’re proud to represent Boone County and continue building a team that’s ready to respond when our community needs us most.
