## Specialized Equipment

Ice rescue requires a specialized set of equipment, including special high flotation insulated dry suits.
These dry suits cost over $1000 each and require patience to correctly don and quite of bit of practice in order to be able to maneuver in the water.

## Classroom Training

Part of our team got the opportunity to participate in an Ice Rescue Class hosted by Boone Fire Department and taught by the skilled team at Professional Rescue Innovations.
While the extreme wind chill and negative temperatures kept us off the ice today, the training provided invaluable knowledge and preparation for future rescues.

Keep an eye out on Boone County's waterways in the coming weeks and months as we put these skills to work during on-the-ice training sessions.
A huge thank you to Boone Fire Department for hosting and to Professional Rescue Innovations for your expertise and dedication to safety.

Training like this ensures we're ready to respond when the community needs us most!

## Hands on Training

This Sunday, many of our members took to the icy waters of Don Williams Lake for hands-on Ice Rescue Training.
Members practiced rescuing others and then took the polar plunge themselves to practice self rescue techniques.

A big thank you to everyone who braved the chilly waters today.
Ice fishing for people might not be our favorite past time, but it's one we take seriously!
