Last night we had the privilege of recognizing Cindy Carpenter, our longest-serving member, with a Lifetime Membership to Boone County Search & Rescue.

Cindy has been with the team through years of change, watching our mission grow, our response evolve, and our capabilities expand. Through it all, sheâ€™s been a steady hand and a dedicated heart, always ready to support the community we serve.

This plaque is just a small way to say thank you for everything sheâ€™s contributed over the years. Weâ€™re grateful for her commitment, and proud to have her as part of our SAR family.
