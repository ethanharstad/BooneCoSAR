Boone County Search & Rescue rolled into the County Fair Parade in style—and brought a very special guest along for the ride… our brand-new Sasquatch mascot!

A huge thank you to all our team members who participated and helped make the day such a success. And an extra shout-out to our awesome Junior SAR members who kept the energy high and the candy flying!

From rescue vehicles and boats to Bigfoot on board, the crowd's reaction was incredible—and we truly felt the support from every smile, wave, and cheer.

This was Sasquatch’s first public appearance, but it definitely won’t be the last.

Thank you, Boone County, for such a warm reception!
