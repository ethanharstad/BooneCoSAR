Boone County Search & Rescue is incredibly grateful to local businesses [Ogden Telephone](https://www.ogdentelephone.com/) and [Walters Sanitary Service](https://www.walterssanitaryservice.com/) for their generous donations! Thanks to their support, we have been able to purchase two Mustang Ice Commander Rescue Suits, a vital addition to our team's lifesaving equipment.

These specialized suits allow our responders  to safely enter frigid, ice-covered waters when every second counts in a rescue. As a 100% volunteer-based, 501(c)(3) non-profit, we rely on community support to continue our mission - not just in Boone County, but across the region whenever we're needed. Donations like these also help us support other First Responder Agencies in their critical work.

Ogden Telephone & Walter's Sanitary Services inc. - Thank you for investing in the safety of our community! Your generosity truly makes a difference.
