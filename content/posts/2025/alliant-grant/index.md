We want to give a huge thank you to Alliant Energy for awarding Boone County Search & Rescue a $1,000 Community Giving Grant!

Thanks to their generous support, we’re able to help purchase new winter jackets for our team. These jackets will ensure our volunteers stay safe and warm while responding to emergencies during Iowa’s harsh winter months.

We’re grateful for partners like Alliant Energy who invest in the safety and resilience of our community!
