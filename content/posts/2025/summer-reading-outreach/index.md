Today was all hands on deck as Boone County Search & Rescue supported not one, but TWO community events to help launch local summer reading programs!

ðŸ•™ 10 AM â€“ 1 PM: Ogden

We joined our partners at Leonard A. Good Community Library alongside the Boone County Sheriffâ€™s Office, Ogden PD, Emergency Management, Boone County 911 Communications, and Jail Staff. It was a great chance to connect with the community and show the tools we use to keep Boone County safe.

ðŸ•“ 4 PM â€“ 7 PM: Boone

Then we raced back to town for the event at Ericson Public Library â€” and what a turnout! Families had a blast exploring emergency vehicles, meeting responders, and even Batman made an appearance!

We also debuted our brand-new inflatable rescue boat and set up a technical rope demo using the climbing wall.

Throughout the day, our members handed out stickers, explained equipment, and showed kids (and adults!) what Search & Rescue is all about.

A huge thank you to both libraries for inviting us and to all the agencies that came out to support these awesome events. Itâ€™s always an honor to be part of something that brings the community together.

Enjoy a few shots from today and keep an eye outâ€¦ Bigfoot might just show up at our next event!
