Today, Boone County Search & Rescue members gathered at Don Williams Lake to continue building the skills that keep our community safe.

On shore, teams trained on hazard assessments, operational zone setup, victim information gathering, and throw bag rescues; critical shoreline techniques at both the Awareness and Operations levels.

On the water, members worked through pre-use inspections, PPE checks, boat handling exercises, and launch and recovery operations, progressing through Awareness, Operations, and even Technician-level boat operation skills.

Training days like today are about more than drills; they're about staying ready to serve, working together as a team, and preparing for the moments when our community needs us most.
