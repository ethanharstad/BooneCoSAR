At 2151 hours on April 19th, Boone County Search & Rescue was dispatched to the High Trestle Trail to support Madrid Fire and Rescue  with a patient who had fallen from the High Trestle Bridge.

Boone County Sheriff's Office deputies were first on scene and quickly deployed drones to locate the patient, guiding Madrid Fire and Boone County Ambulance crews to the location.

Boone County Search & Rescue launched our rescue boat from the nearby HWY 210 Boat Ramp and met with fire and EMS personnel, who had stabilized and packaged the patient. The patient was transferred to our boat and transported to the ramp, where waiting team members assisted in carrying the patient to an awaiting Life Flight helicopter for rapid transport to definitive care.

This call exemplifies the outstanding interagency cooperation across Boone County’s emergency services. We’re proud to serve alongside such dedicated partners!
