title: About Boone County SAR
---

Founded in the 1960s during the Cold War, Boone County Search & Rescue originally assisted the Boone County Civil Defense with emergency preparations, including filling roles like Auxiliary Policemen.
Over the years, as needs evolved, the unit shifted its focus to technical rescues, offering services like land-based search, specialized water rescue, and scuba recovery.

As Boone County’s emergency services grew, Search & Rescue adapted, often supplementing the work of local fire departments and law enforcement.
Our volunteer team has provided essential support, from traffic control at large events to supplying breathing air for firefighters.

Today, Boone County Search & Rescue is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, operating with fewer members and donations than in the past, but we remain dedicated to the high standards we’ve always upheld.
Our current efforts include the only water rescue and recovery team in the county, which is equipped with three vessels for different water conditions.
We also use advanced ground search software to help coordinate land searches.

In addition, we are training new teams for chainsaw operations and rope rescue, which will help fill the current gap in the county’s capabilities, as only one fire department currently offers rope rescue.

We continue to evolve to meet the needs of the community.
